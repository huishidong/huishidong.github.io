## I need to setup a personal website to document my studies and works.

This new requirement of my life is inspired by [如何正确地装逼][1p3a-post], some requests on my coding projects during my job search process, and a promise on sharing my trading industry knowledge with my friends.

I am an engineer with decent knowledge on network, cloud, `git`, `markdown` and open source softwares, but I have little knowledge on `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, I need something to bridge the gap.

## As an experienced software engineer, in order to achieve my goal quickly, I will try to start with baby steps:

- use a static web site as a start.
- generated HTML/CSS..., with decent themes.
- good version control.
- easy to deploy my site.
- enough flexibility for me to hack around and learn the web technology.
- seek ways to get feedback on my content effectively.
- easy to migrate to other technology

[GitHub Page][gh-page] and [Jekyll][jekyll] seems to be a good option. It meets all the requirements above.

So here is it, this first meaningful blog post using `Jekyll` on my [github site][gh-huishidong]

## Steps I've taken:

- [install ruby 3.1.2][install-ruby-312] with [rbenv][rbenv] on my good old ubuntu 20.4
- [install `bundler` and `jekyll`][install-jekyll-ubuntu]
- [follow github steps to create my jekyll page][create-gh-page]

This is a good start!
